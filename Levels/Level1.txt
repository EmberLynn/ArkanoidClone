Duplicate this file and fill in all listed variables with desired output for level design.
The dashed lines are a visual representation of how the blocks layout in the level will look.
Row and column totals are abstracted from the visual. If block width, height, and level width and height
are not compatible (that many blocks can't fit as that many columns considering the width of the screen!),
a (helpful) error will be throw.
